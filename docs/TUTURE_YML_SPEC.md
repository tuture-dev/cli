## `name`

**[Required]** Name of your tutorial.

This will be displayed as the title of your tutorial in [tuture-renderer](https://github.com/tutureproject/renderer). By default it's *My Awesome Tutorial*.

Try to be informative and attractive, such as *Build Your Own NoSQL Database with Python*, and don't use general descriptions (or something like a book title), for instance *Learning JavaScript*.

## `language`

Language of your tutorial.

Note that it's about **natural languages** that your tutorial is written in, not **programming languages**. Tuture fully appreciates the importance of internationlization (aka i18n), so tutorials will be divided into different groups by languages.

## `version`

Version of your tutorial.

## `topics`

Topics covered in this tutorial.

Programming languages, libraries, frameworks, tools, software engineering and everything in between can serve as a valid topic.

## `description`

Short description of your tutorial.

This helps people quickly discover your tutorial and get interested in it.

## `email`

Maintainer email.

## `steps`

**[Required]** Steps for readers to follow.

This field should contain at least one step. Each step corresponds with one commit in your Git repo strictly. For each step, you should stick to the renowned and respected UNIX philosiphy - **Do One Thing and Do It Well**. Finally, you can freely adjust the order of diff files for convenience of explanation.

Here is the specification of a single step.

### `name`

Name of this step. This will be automatically filled with corresponding commit message. You can rewrite this as you see fit.

### `commit`

Corresponding commit ID. Please **do not** manually edit this field.

### `explain`

Explanation for this step. Generally you can explain what will be done in this single step.

### `diff`

Added or changed files in this step. Each file has three fields:

#### `file`

Path to this changed file (from the tutorial root). Tuture will extract this information for you from Git logs.

#### `explain`

This is similar to `explain` of a step. You should explain why this file is added or changed.

#### `collapse`

Whether this file should be collapsed by default. Tuture will set `collapse: true` by default for following filename patterns:

- package-lock.json
- yarn.lock
- .gitignore
